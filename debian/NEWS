ruby1.8 (1.8.6.111-1) unstable; urgency=low

  This package includes fixes for CVE-2007-5162.

  The upstream author had taken two actions about CVE-2007-5162.

    1) They released Ruby 1.8.6-p111 and 1.8.5-p114.  But the release
       requires to change user's code to verify server's identity.

         http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2007/10/04/net-https-vulnerability/ [en]
         http://www.ruby-lang.org/ja/news/2007/10/04/isecpartners-com-2007-006-rubyssl/ [ja]

    2) The upstream author re-added some fixes for Ruby.  It makes Ruby
       verify server's identity on default.  This is available on ruby_1_8
       branch, trunk of the Ruby repository and next release of Ruby 1.8.x.

  On Debian, we took the 2nd action of the above.  

  New ruby1.8 package makes Ruby (Net::HTTPS, Net::IMAP, Net::FTPTLS and
  Net::TELNETS) verify server's identity on default if SSL connection
  isn't in VERIFY_NONE mode.  It require no change user's code.
